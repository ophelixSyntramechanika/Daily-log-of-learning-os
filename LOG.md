" i setup wsl,nasm,qemu"
** Today i learned how to make a bootloader using nasm where i simply printed a character on the screeen ** 
** I learned about 0x7C00,0x0E,0x10,0xAA55 , what it does and why is it needed there**

2.2025/05/06
**Today was a hecctic day so i only learned about the assembler instruction which i equire to create a os **
**i have uploaded the pdf to learn it**

3. 2025/05/07
**Today i learned abouthow to convert from the binary into hexadecimal as it was found important**
**i learned about the interrupts,ISR,**
**four general purpose register
mov ax, 1234
 mov cx, 0x234
 mov dx, t
 mov bx, ax
**
**i wrote my first code by understanding and remembering what to do and i understood and wrote without looking at any code**
**the code is printout the infinite loop one is bootsector.asm**

4. 2025/05/08
**from the book i used the memory referncing and dereferncing by using th bx register and why bx is used becasue it is allowed for indirect memory adressing and learned about the[org] directive and for defining string inside the code in the bois screen**

5.2025/05/09
**learned about the stack with example and about the push and pop and the how the stack pointer is calculated so [sp=starting adress-2]and if the push A meaning push stores the value of 0041 in 0x7ffe**
**please learn the stack from example if you ask me if you want to know it works,thats how i learned it too and tomorrow i will learn the asm instruction and write simple code for assembly to help me build the os**

10.2025/05/10
**i solved the task but it still shows error for blank screen and i cant seem to figure it out** will try tomorrow agaian**

11.2025/05/11
**learned about the control and conditional jump and solved two task ,always solve two to three example and always think why you need that thing in that place **

12.2025/05/12
**i leanred about the function call and ret and pusha and popa for protecting the data and the registers**

13.2025/05/13
**
what i learned today
 SI & lodsb---->>> Used to read strings from memory
 Looping---->>> Printed each character one by one
 Functions---->>> Called print_string cleanly with call / ret
 Dots in labels---->>> Learned they help organize code inside functions
 Why it matters---->>> Understood how this builds up toward a real OS**
